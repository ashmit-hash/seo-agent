## ✨ Features

### 🤖 Dual-Model AI Engine
Choose the model that fits your workflow without changing any code. Toggle between:
- **Anthropic Claude** (`claude-opus-4-5`) — leverages the native `web_search` tool for deep, grounded research
- **OpenAI GPT-4o** (`gpt-4o-search-preview`) — integrated web search with broad reasoning capability

Both models are implemented via **native REST API `fetch` calls** — no bloated SDK wrappers.

### 🔎 Agentic Web Search — Grounded in Reality
Unlike prompt-only agents that hallucinate outdated facts, this agent actively browses the web at runtime to:
- Audit your target website's content, tone, and niche
- Identify and analyze real competitor pages
- Validate keyword relevance against live search results

### 📊 Free Real-Time SERP Analytics
A custom-built DuckDuckGo HTML scraper powered by `cheerio` replaces paid SERP tools entirely. It pulls:
- Live search rankings for target keywords
- Competitor page snippets and metadata
- Related search queries for semantic keyword expansion

Zero API keys. Zero monthly fees. 100% operational.

### 🚦 7-Step Gated Workflow

| Step | Stage | What Happens | Output |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Website Analysis | AI audits your site's niche, tone, audience, and content gaps | Strategic site profile |
| 2 | Competitor Research | Browses top-ranking competitor pages live | Competitive intelligence matrix |
| 3 | Topic Generation | Proposes 10 data-backed blog topics aligned to your audience | Curated topic list |
| 4 | Keyword Research | Maps primary/secondary keywords with search intent | Keyword + intent table |
| 5 | Blog Outline | Builds a structured H2/H3 content blueprint | Editable outline |
| 6 | Full Blog Post | Writes a 1,800–2,500 word Markdown article | Publication-ready post |
| 7 | SEO Output | Packages all on-page SEO metadata | Meta title, description, slug, tags |

### 🎛️ Human-in-the-Loop Control Gates
The agent pauses at three critical decision points before proceeding, letting you:
- Swap or customize the selected blog topic
- Edit the outline structure before writing begins
- Review and approve the final post before SEO packaging

You get the speed of AI with the judgment of a human editor.

### 🎨 Premium SaaS UI
No utility-class frameworks — every pixel is hand-crafted in **Vanilla CSS**:
- Light-themed, distraction-free writing environment
- Fluid step-transition animations
- Dynamic competitor data matrix with visual hierarchy
- **Plus Jakarta Sans** for headings, **Inter** for body text
- **Lucide icons** throughout for a consistent, modern icon language
